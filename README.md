# AskSteve

The first week on any college campus is hectic, but what if there was a digital assistant available 24/7 to help new students and their families navigate the college process? With that idea i mind we have built a conversational agent called **Steve** for **Stevens institute of Technology** that can engage with student round the clock and provide them with the information they need in real-time. 

Upon arriving to the campus most students have question such as _"where should i collect my ID card Office?"_ or _"Where can i find Campus shuttles?"_ etc. The process of answering such FAQ's is automated using 'Steve' which would enable the administrative staff to work on matters that really require their expertise.

## How was it built?
The chatbot was built using *__Microsoft Bot-Framework__*, *__Microsoft LUIS__*( Natural Language Understanding), *__Algolia__* (Knowledge Base), *__Google Maps__*(Mapping, Geocoding), *__Azure Cloud__* (Hosting) and *__Facebook messenger__* (Chat Interface). 

## Current Project scope
Location Services: In the first stage of the project, we have focused on the location services. The bot is currently capable of answering any location based question related to stevens
